Nothing new here comparing to the previous project, but I had to use a temporary local variable inside the looping por excanging values between the other variables involved in the sequence.

## Prerequisites

- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable configured

   ```sh
   cd *cloned-path* /00\ -\ Fibonacci

2. **Compile the program:**
    ```sh
    javac Fibonacci.java

3. **Run the program:**
    ```sh
    java Fibonacci
