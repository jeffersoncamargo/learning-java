# Hello World in Java

My first "from scratch" project made with Java. Here I have tried to implement protected functions inside the same class of the main method and I also had my first contact with the "import" statement and the Java Scanner class.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable configured

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd *cloned-path* /00\ -\ Calculator

2. **Compile the program:**
    ```sh
    javac Calculator.java

3. **Run the program:**
    ```sh
    java Calculator
