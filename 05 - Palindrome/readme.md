# Palindrome in Java

A new variable type is present in this challenge, the String. Besides that, I had to deal with the necessity of manually inverting the string, but it was the same way I used to do in C while I was beggining in the development world.

One curiotity is that I had never heard about the existence of a "equals" methos inside the String class of Java, but reading a little bit by the class constructor, I found it and though it would be a good idea to try it here.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable configured

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd *cloned-path* /00\ -\ Palindrome
