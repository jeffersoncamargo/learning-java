# Temperature conversion in Java

The operations inside this program was so similar to the Calculator, but I tried to add some new structures to bring my "C like"syntax knowledge from PHP to Java.

Here I used a Do/While looping structure for garanteeing a right choise for the conversion type anda also used 3 ternary operators for avoiding lots of ifs. For my surprise, most of the syntax and class organization that I've been using in the PHP (newer versions) is very similar and I had to research only a few thing to get this point of the learning process.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable configured

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd *cloned-path* /00\ -\ Temperature\ convertion

2. **Compile the program:**
    ```sh
    javac TemperatureConversion.java

3. **Run the program:**
